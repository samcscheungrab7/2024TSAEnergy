Costs of Green Energy
</font></b>
<br><br>
<table width=80%>

<font size=+1>
One major concern of many homeowners is what the cost of green and clean energy is. The following information walks through the cost of providing this type of energy in your own house and providing it for the nation as a tax paying citizen. 
<br><br>
The cost for different types of clean energies all depends on the state you live in, the amount of watages you plan to use, and the company you buy from. Solar Panels for example range from $17,430 to $23,870. Another example is owning a small group of wind turbines for home use will be approximately $15,000 to $75,000 for having 5 to 15 kW of power capacity. Research your options before investing to find the best cost effective investment for your situation.

How to Lower the Expenses
</font></b>

<table width=80%>

Stay informed about tax rebate information. Many government and green energy sites release updated information about benefits provided by the government for homeowners who invest in clean and green energy solutions for their homes. These tax credits are known as the ITC and PTC, and they will be further explained in the next section of this page.
<br><br>
Research for possible clean and cost efficient alternative options. If you want to use solar energy consider looking into outdoor solar lights for walkways and porches. Their installation is easy and their cost is low. Another simple way to use solar energy at a cheaper price is getting a solar portable charger. They will restore energy to your device when out in the sun and their price is around $15.
<br><br>
Look into your electric bills and see what you can easily change. One that comes highly recommended is switching to a solar water heater. A normal water heater uses around $440 dollars of electricity per year and a solar water heater costs $250 to $1,200. Another possibility is connecting certain appliances to green energy generators. Both of these solutions will save you lots of money in a couple years time without the large expense of fully switching. It’s a great starting point for you as a homeowner to see what switching to clean energy will look like for you.

What is ITC and PTC?</font></b><a name="iTP"></a>
<br><br>
<table width=80%>

<font size=+1>
ITC and PTC are the two types of tax credit options for those investing in green energy solutions. They are available for certain projects, but one project is not able to receive both types of credits. We encourage you to research both of these options to see which type of credit is best for your project
<br><br>
ITC will provide owners with 30% of the value of their project. The IRS released a statement saying, “The Residential Clean Energy Credit equals 30% of the costs of new, qualified clean energy property for your home installed anytime from 2022 through 2032”. This is for any home owner who invests in clean energy solutions for their home, and it encourages homeowners to make the investment
<br><br>
PTC awards credit based on the amount of watages a clean energy source is used for in a home. Evergreen Action writes, “For every kWh of clean energy generated, the producer gets a base credit of 2.6¢/kWh (again, provided they meet certain labor standards). Historically that’s been roughly equivalent in value to the 30 percent ITC”. This is for any owner of a green energy source that regularly produces watages of energy, and it is meant to encourage users to produce more clean energy instead of relying on other sources.
